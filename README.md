open 3 terminals \
in terminal one type in go run server/server.go -port 5454 \
in terminal two type in go run client/client.go -sPort 5454 \
in terminal three type in go run client/client.go -sPort 5454 

it's possible to open however many terminals you want and create new clients in each of them 

now you can send whatever message in terminal two and three
